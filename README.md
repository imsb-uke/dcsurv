# Discrete Calibrated Survival
This repository provides the code to "Deep Learning-Based Discrete Calibrated Survival
Prediction". A novel deep learning survival analysis approach called DCS. We also include the [original paper](fuhlert-2022.pdf) and its [supplemental material](supplemental-material.pdf) in this repository.
